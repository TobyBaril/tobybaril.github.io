    abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) play crucial roles in genome evolution and ecological adaptation in fungi, yet their dynamics in ectomycorrhizal species remain poorly understood. Cenococcum geophilum, the most widespread ectomycorrhizal fungus in boreal and temperate forests with its large, repeat-rich genome, represents an ideal system to investigate TE-mediated adaptation to the physical environment and symbiotic lifestyle. However, previous studies have been limited by fragmented genome assemblies that prevented the resolution of repeat-rich regions. We assembled a telomere-to-telomere reference genome of C. geophilum strain 1.58 using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C datasets, resulting in a 178.54 Mbp genome with seven contiguous chromosomes. We identified 14,145 genes and over 78\% of the genome consists of transposable elements (TEs). Of these, 94\% are affected by repeat-induced point mutations (RIP), a genome defence mechanism that acts during the sexual reproduction phase, indicating cryptic or ancient sexual reproduction in this putatively asexual fungus. LTR retrotransposons, LINEs, and DNA transposons dominated, with three TE families (Ty3, Ty1, and Tad1) contributing over 60\% of the genome size, indicating recent transposition bursts. Screening of 15 additional C. geophilum strains revealed recent and lineage-specific TE expansions, implying that several TEs escaped the RIP machinery and retained potential activity. Supporting TE activity in the context of symbiosis, we found 56 TEs differentially transcribed between ectomycorrhizal and free-living mycelium tissues. An even higher number (n = 66) of TEs were differentially expressed between stress resistance morphology (i.e., sclerotia) and free-living mycelium. This supports that TEs are differentially regulated as a response to symbiotic and stress-related conditions. Our results demonstrate that the C. geophilum genome expansion was driven by a few lineage-specific TE families in recent history, with high RIP activity attesting to sexual reproduction. We also provide insights how TEs could respond to lifestyle transitions and traits associated with desiccation resistance.},
